A PIR sensor based security alarm system.
This project showcases a simple, reliable, and fully hardware-based security alarm system that uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect human motion. The system activates a buzzer or siren the moment movement is detected — all without any Arduino, microcontroller, or programming.
Uses a PIR motion sensor to detect body heat and movement
Activates a buzzer/siren the moment motion is detected
Low power consumption and easy to assemble
Suitable for home, office, and small-area security applications
